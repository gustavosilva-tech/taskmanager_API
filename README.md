# Task Management API
Welcome to the Task Management API, a backend application built with FastAPI and SQLite to manage project tasks. This API allows you to create, list, update, and delete tasks, making it ideal for learning about REST API development and database integration.

# Purpose
The purpose of this API is to provide a simple and functional interface for managing tasks, with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It is an educational project aimed at developers who want to practice backend concepts such as data validation, persistence, and REST endpoint design.

# Technologies Used
Python 3.12: Main programming language.

FastAPI: Framework for building fast and modern APIs.

SQLAlchemy: ORM for interacting with the database.

SQLite: Lightweight, embedded database used for storage.
